/// QUICK TOUR:
/// 
/// This widget is almost same as `flutter_rating_bar` in pub dev with few 
/// additional features in [VTSRatingWidget], such as custom size for each
/// rating and show color for ONLY chosen rating (check field 
/// `isShowOnly1Rating`).
/// 
/// 1. [VTSRatingBar] -  This widget allows user drag to choose a rating (check
/// fields `glowColor`, `glow`, `glowRadius`,...).
/// 
/// 2. [VTSRatingBarIndicator]
